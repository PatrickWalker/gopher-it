## Composition

  

We've now introduced the building blocks for Go's powerful composition

techniques: custom types, methods, interfaces, and struct embedding.

### What if I don't know?


Obviously we all know the secret handshake of composition. I mean it says right there that EVERYONE knows but for the sake of er completeness let's just recite the pledge of allegiance to composition

  

 - Composition asks you to think about objects as what they DO rather than what they are. Actions seemingly change less often than objects
 - Changing behaviour is easier as due to interfaces and being action orientated we can inject different implementations of behaviour in at runtime. 
 - Multiple inheritance is both difficult and rare. So the ability to make specialised objects can become a spaghetti as you make an 'abstract' super class to allow for the inheritance model that has no basis in the real domain. When creating birds and planes do you make a 'flyer' class?

Is composition always better? General trend seems to say pretty much and in Go it's non optional so we'll keep moving ahead

  

### Example

  

Composition is more than just type embedding; it's about declaring and

implementing discrete behaviour, creating types that have a single purpose,

and then using these blocks to build higher level behaviours by composing the discrete behaviours.

  

Let's put all these techniques together. First we'll define a type representing a location, and two interfaces detailing behaviour.

  

```go

type  point  struct {

x, y int

}

type  mover  interface {

moveTo(p point)
}

type  firer  interface {

fire()

}

```

  

Now we'll define a new type for a vehicle, embedding the location. We'll also make this type satisfy one of our interfaces.


```go

type  vehicle  struct {

point

passengers int
}


func  (v *vehicle) moveTo(p point) {
v.point = p
}

```

  
Let's also have a weapon, again satisfying the appropriate interface.
```go

type  weapon  struct {

loaded bool

}

func  (w *weapon) fire() {

w.loaded = false

}

```

  

With a bit more struct embedding, we can compose our `vehicle` and `weapon` types to create a `tank`.

  

```go

type  tank  struct {

vehicle

weapon

}

```

  

Here we'll introduce a familiar concept with a slight twist: it's type embedding, but with an interface. It works in exactly the same way as with a struct.

  

```go

type  moverFirer  interface {

mover

firer

}

  

func  moveAndFire(mf moverFirer, p point) {

mf.moveTo(p)

mf.fire()

}

```

  

And finally, let's wrap everything together. We'll create a new `tank`, and then use our `moveAndFire` function to do just that.

  

```go

func  main() {

t := &tank{

vehicle{point{5, 6}, 6},

weapon{true},

}

moveAndFire(t, point{10, 20})


fmt.Printf("Location: %v; Passengers: %d; Loaded: %t\n",

t.point, t.passengers, t.loaded)

  

// Location: {10 20}; Passengers: 6; Loaded: false

}

```
