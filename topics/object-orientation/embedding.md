## Embedding

 
Go's type system does not typical OO inheritance; instead it supports composition with the ability to "borrow" functionality by embedding named types as anonymous fields of another struct type through a process called _type embedding_.

  

Let's define two types that are shapes inside a 3D drawing package:

  

```go

type  sphere  struct {

x, y, z, radius int

}

  

type  cube  struct {

x, y, z, length int

}

```

  

Looking at these two types, and considering what new types we might want to create, we can see that the location of the shape is common to all shapes, so we're going to get a lot of repetition.


We can factor out the common parts (the location) by creating a `point` type, but this can make accessing the fields cumbersome and verbose, especially if we then used these types as part of further types.

```go

type  point  struct {

x, y, z int

}

  

type  sphere  struct {

point point

radius int

}

  

type  cube  struct {

point point

length int

}

  

var  s sphere

s.point.x = 5

s.point.y = 6

s.point.z = 7

s.radius = 3

```

  

Go allows us to declare a field with a type but no name. These fields are
called _anonymous fields_, and are said to be _embedded_ within the type. For example, we can embed `point` within `sphere` and `cube`.

```go

type  point  struct {

x, y, z int

}

  

type  sphere  struct {

point

radius int

}


type  cube  struct {

point

length int

}

```

  

Go automatically "promotes" the embedded types so the fields within those types are accessible from the top level.
  

```go

var  s sphere

s.x = 5  // equivalent to s.point.x = 5

s.y = 6  // equivalent to s.point.y = 6

s.z = 7  // equivalent to s.point.z = 7

s.radius = 3

```

  

Although embedded fields are known as _anonymous_, that's not strictly true:

they do have names, which are the same as the type name, and using these names is optional in dot expressions.

  

There is no shorthand for defining struct literals with embedded types, so we have to declare each embedded type explicitly.

  

```go

s1 := sphere{point{1, 2, 3}, 5}

  

s2 := sphere{

point: point{

1,

2,

3,

},

radius: 5, // required trailing comma

}

```

  

The inner type promotion works not just for the fields of embedded types, but also for methods on the inner type. This is the primary mechanism through which complex object behaviours are composed from simpler ones in Go.

  

```go

type  robot  struct { }

func  (r robot) talk() { fmt.Println("Bzzzzzbt") }

  

type  robby  struct {

robot

}

  

robby := robby{}

robby.talk() // Bzzzzzbt

```

  

The outer type can override the inner type's behaviour.

  

```go

type  robot  struct { }

func  (r robot) talk() { fmt.Println("Bzzzzzbt") }

  

type  robby  struct {

robot

}

func  (r robby) talk() { fmt.Println("Again?") }

  

robby := robby{}

robby.talk() // Again?

```

  

And methods promoted from an inner type can also allow the outer type so

satisfy an interface.

  

```go

type  talker  interface { talk() }

  

type  robot  struct{}

func  (r robot) talk() { fmt.Println("Bzzzzzbt") }

  

type  robby  struct { robot }

  

func  talk(t talker) {

t.talk()

}

  

talk(robby{})

```

  

### Exercise

  

> Create a user type and an admin type that embeds a user. Create a Notifier interface, and make your user type satisfy that interface. Write a function  that accepts a value of the interface type, and ensure it works correctly when passed a value of your admin type.
