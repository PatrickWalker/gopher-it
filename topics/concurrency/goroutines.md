## Goroutines

  

A goroutine is simply a function or method running independently (but in the same address space as other goroutines). The Go scheduler **multiplexes
goroutines against one or more OS threads**, which are in turn managed by the OS to assign work to individual CPU cores. It's perfectly normal to create thousands of goroutines in a single process; they're not free, but they're very cheap.

 In Java you work in terms of threads, this are analogous to OS threads. Go can start more routines than threads so were you may run 1,000's or 10,000's of Java threads you can run 100,000's or millions of go routines. 

 The differences can be summarised as Memory Consumption (default jvm stack size is 1m?), startup costs (os resources vs go runtime resources) and Switching costs (which i flat out dont understand but 3 registers to update vs many more)

Let's create a function to simulate some form of work, and we'll call that multiple times.

  

```go

func  doWork(i int) {

time.Sleep(time.Millisecond * 500)

fmt.Println(i)

}

  

func  main() {

for  i := 1; i <= 5; i++ {

doWork(i)

}

}

```

  

If we run that script, it does exactly what we'd expect: outputs each number

one after the other, in order, and takes approximately 5 times the time it

would take to run once.

  

```

$ time go run g1.go

1

2

3

4

5

go run g1.go ... 2.757 total

```

  

It's simple to launch any function or method call as a goroutine: simply add

the `go` keyword in front of the call.

  

```go

go  someFunc() // Concurrency!

```

  

Here's out previous program, and we can see that we've added the `go` keyword in the loop, so we're launching each of our invocations of `doWork()` in its own goroutine.

  

```go

func  doWork(i int) {

time.Sleep(time.Millisecond * 500)

fmt.Println(i)

}

  

func  main() {

for  i := 1; i <= 5; i++ {

go  doWork(i) // Concurrency!

}

}

```

  

So let's run the script again!

  

```

$ time go run g2.go

go run g2.go ... 0.247 total

```

  

Uh oh, where's all our output gone? Here's an important thing about goroutines:
when you start a goroutine, the calling code doesn't wait for the goroutine to finish, but just continues running through the rest of the code. The `main()` function is actually a goroutine itself, so once that finishes, the program ends.

  

Let's introduce one method of solving this problem: the wait group. A wait
group is a counting semaphore. We use `wg.Add(n)` to increment the count, and `wg.Done()` to decrement it. A call to `wg.Wait()` will block the calling goroutine until the wait group's value is zero.

  

```go

import  "sync"

  

func  main() {

var  wg sync.WaitGroup

wg.Add(1)

  

go  func() {

// Do work...

wg.Done()

}()

  

wg.Wait()

}

```

  

We've also introduced two new concepts here: anonymous functions (a function that is not bound to an identifier), and closures (functions that can access variables local to the scope it was created in, e.g. the `wg` value).

  

So let's apply that concept to our previous example.


```go

func  main() {

var  wg sync.WaitGroup

  

for  i := 1; i <= 5; i++ {

wg.Add(1)

  

go  func(x int) {

defer wg.Done()

doWork(x)

}(i)

}

  

wg.Wait()

}

```

We're adding to the WaitGroup on each loop, then calling an anonymous function with the current value of `i` (if we just used `i` directly, then due to the closure the value passed to our `doWork()` function would be the value of `i` at the point the function was called, which may have changed from when the anonymous function was defined).

Clear as mud?  [playground](https://play.golang.org/p/FkK4gyKPaPy)

  

We've also added a call to `defer`. This statement pushes a function call on to a list, and the list of saved calls is executed after the surrounding
 function returns. It is commonly used to simplify functions that perform various clean-up operations, such as closing a file handle, or to decrement a WaitGroup like in our example. Deferred statements run even if the function results in a panic. Similar to a 'using' or try-finally keyword in c# or try-finally/try with resources in Java

  

Now we've done all that, let's run our program again.

  

```

$ time go run g3.go

4

1

5

2

3

go run g3.go ... 0.752 total

```

  

We can see that each goroutine is now running concurrently with the others, and the total time taken is approximately that for a single call to `doWork()`.

### Questions

 - True or False - Go Routines are analogous to Threads and map 1-2-1
 - What is the go keyword to start a go routine
 - Why would you use a WaitGroup or similar?
 - What's an anonymous function?
 - A waitgroup is a counting semaphor. What is a semaphor?
 - What does defer do?

### Exercise

  

> Create two anonymous functions: one that outputs integers from 1 to 100; the  other from 100 to 1. Start each function as a goroutine. Use a WaitGroup to ensure that main() doesn't exit until the goroutines are done.
